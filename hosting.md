# Hosting
General resources, applications and tools about self hosting.

## Applications
- [traefik](https://github.com/traefik/traefik)  
  *Super easy to configure and versatile edge server and reverse proxy for services hosted on Docker or bare metal. I also made a [video](https://youtu.be/lQTIOZ6ZRFI) about it!*
- [portainer](https://github.com/portainer/portainer)  
  *Web app to manage Docker deployments (which can also be deployed using Docker ðŸ¤¯).*

## Cloud Platforms
- [contabo](https://contabo.com/de/)  
  *Here I am currently hosting most of my services and my private VPS. They are very cheap and I never had any problems with their reliability and performance. The only downsight is that they are not as flexible as other providers.*
- [HetznerÂ¹](https://hetzner.cloud/?ref=BHITlb2eKat9)
  *Very reliable, performant and flexible cloud host. You can rent dedicated servers as well as VPS which are online in seconds and payed hourly. So, if you need some resources for a scraper or something like that, don't use GCS or AWS and consider using their service which is much cheaper and you don't make your app dependent on your infrastructure.*

## Selfhosting
- [minio](https://github.com/minio/minio)  
  *Self hosted object storage like Amazon S3.*
- [nextcloud](https://nextcloud.com/)  
  *Self hosted cloud storage service which is also web-dav capable.*
- [trilium](https://github.com/zadam/trilium)  
  *Self hosted notes database and web application.*
- [Teamspeak 3](https://hub.docker.com/_/teamspeak)  
  *Docker image to host a Teamspeak 3 server.*
