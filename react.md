# React
My abolsute favorite web app library I've used for several of my open source projects. 

## Libraries
- [styled-components](https://github.com/styled-components/styled-components)  
  *A fancy library which allows CSS styling in JS making theaming, binding styles to properties and style abstraction easy.*
- [zustand](https://github.com/pmndrs/zustand)  
  *Stupid simple state library which utilizes reacts functional hook scheme to manage a global state. I even made a [video](https://youtu.be/ectZzJT9xBs) about it!*
- [react-router](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router)  
  *Simple URL routing.*
