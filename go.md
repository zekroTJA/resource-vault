# Go
I am working with the Go language since late 2017 and now, it evolved to my most used language for my personal projects. Also, since April 2022, I am now as well part of a Go development team in a company here in Germany. ðŸ¥³

I also created some packages myself which I am also using a lot in my projects, so I've also listed them here even though it is kind of a shameless plug. ðŸ˜…
