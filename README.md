# Resource Vault

This is my personal vault of general resources and documents for all subjects of development, design and media work.

This database can be used with [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/). Just clone (or download) this repository and open it in Obsidian. ✨  

Also, this vault is subject to be extended at any time I find something new or remember something I already used which is worthy to be added to this vault.

This project was strongly inspired by @voxain's [resource-vault](https://github.com/voxain/resource-vault). Please feel free to also take a look at their lists. 😉
